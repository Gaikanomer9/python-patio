## Detecting useless words anywhere in the system

Disclaimer: testing only on Mac OS.

Starting the project:

```
cd FirstEpisode/Detect\ Useless\ Words
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you are using Mac OS, 
it is important to add python and terminal app access to Privacy tab.

To launch the app use `python detect_words.py`, now without closing it, type anywhere 
the word "very"
